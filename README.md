# Stick Hero Game

## Description

This project entails developing a JavaFX game inspired by Stick Hero, utilizing object-oriented programming principles. The core gameplay involves guiding a character, the stick hero, across platforms by extending a stick to the precise length needed. If the stick is either too short or too long, the character will fall. Throughout the journey, the character can collect rewards, such as cherries, and navigate towards the goal. The objective is to create an engaging and challenging game that maintains the fundamental mechanics of Stick Hero while introducing unique features.

## Features

- **JavaFX Implementation:** Provides a rich and interactive graphical user interface.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Ensures clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- **Multithreading:** Handles game animations and user interactions smoothly.
- **JUnit Testing:** Ensures comprehensive testing for game functionality and reliability.
